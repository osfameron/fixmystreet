<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What is the City of Readers Map Project?</dt>
        <dd>
            <b>FIX ME!</b>
</dd>

        <dt>Who is this project run by?</dt>
        <dd> See the <a href="http://www.cityofreaders.org/">City of Readers</a>
        website for full details! </dd>

        <dt>What software is running this site?</dt>
        <dd>This map uses FixMyStreet by mySociety.  FixMyStreet is a site to
        help people report, view, or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found
        to their local council by simply locating them on a map. It launched in
        early February 2007.</dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After entering a postcode or location, you are presented
with a map of that area. You can view stories already reported in that area,
or tell ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>

        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes.
</dd>

        <dt> Where did you get the book icons on the map from? </dt>
        <dd> These are from the <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset:minecraft-icons"> Minecraft Icons</a> set by <a href="http://chrisl21.deviantart.com/">ChrisL21 on deviantart</a>
        (with minor tweaks to get them in different colours) used with permission as non-commercial usage.

    <dt>Can I use the City of Readers Map on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The FixMyStreet website should work on your mobile phone, adapting to
    the size of your screen automatically. We plan to release updated native
    apps in the near future.
    <ul>
    <li><em>iPhone:</em> Our basic app from 2008 is available for download
    on the App Store:
    <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fixmystreet/id297456545">FixMyStreet</a>,
    <li><em>Android:</em> A volunteer, Anna Powell-Smith, has written an app
    available from the 
    <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.android.fixmystreet">Android Market</a>.
    <li><em>Nokia:</em> A volunteer, Thomas Forth, has written an app available from the
    <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/107557">Ovi Store</a>.
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>Neither City of Readers nor FixMyStreet is not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>
    <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
    <dd>Thanks for asking politely &ndash; we never quite understand why some of the rudest
    emails we receive are on this topic. The British national
    grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey (the British national
    mapping agency) around the time of the second world war, uses eastings and
    northings measured in metres and kilometres; the maps we use are from
    Ordnance Survey and so this is what we use to display distances.
    There you have it: not everything British is in miles!</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep FixMyStreet locally focused, so restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will let you see all
    the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If you&rsquo;re from the
    council then the emailed version of the problem report also contains the
    closest road and postcode to the pin on the map.</dd>

    <h2><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who gets to see my email address?</dt>
        <dd>If you submit a problem, we pass on your details, and details
of the story, to the City of Readers team.
Only people we authorise to view the FixMyStreet administration interface
will be able to see your email address and they will never use it for anything other than 
to help administer the map. Similarly with email addresses from updates. We will never give or sell your email address to anyone else, 
unless we are obliged to by law. Your name will not be published anywhere unless you let us.</dd>
        <dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address?</dt>
        <dd>Never. We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
problem you&rsquo;ve reported, and send you a questionnaire email four weeks
after you submit a problem, asking for a status update; we&rsquo;ll only ever
send you emails in relation to your problem.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Organisation Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who built FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>This site was built by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>,
        in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/">Young Foundation</a>.
mySociety is the project of a registered charity which has grown out of the community of
volunteers who built sites like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>. 
mySociety&rsquo;s primary mission is to build Internet projects which give people simple, tangible
benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. Our first project
was <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>, where you can write to any of your
elected representatives, for free. The charity is called UK Citizens Online Democracy and is charity number 1076346. mySociety 
can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:hello&#64;mysociety.org">hello&#64;mysociety.org</a>,
or by post at mySociety, 483 Green Lanes, London, N13 4BS, UK.</dd>
<p>
    The City of Readers map project was built by Hakim Cassimally (of
    mySociety, but as a personal project), originally at an
    <a href="http://impact48.org/2013/12/19/a-readerly-impact48/">Impact48</a> hack-weekend.
</p>
        <dt><img src="/i/moj.png" align="right" alt="Ministry of Justice" hspace="10">Who pays for it?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet was originally paid for via the Department for
        Constitutional Affairs Innovations Fund. It is now funded by a variety of means, from commercial
        work to <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/donate/">donations</a>.</dd>
        <dt><a name="nfi"></a>Wasn&rsquo;t this site called Neighbourhood Fix-It?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, we changed the name mid June 2007. We decided
Neighbourhood Fix-It was a bit of a mouthful, hard to spell, and hard to publicise (does the URL have a dash in it or not?). The domain FixMyStreet became available, and everyone liked the name.</dd>
        <dt>Do you need any help with the project?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, we can use help in all sorts of ways, technical or
non-technical.  Please see our <a
href="http://www.mysociety.org/helpus/">Get Involved page</a>.</dd>
        <dt>I&rsquo;d like a site like this for my own location/ where&rsquo;s the "source code" to this site?</dt>
        <dd>
The software behind this site is open source, and available
to you mainly under the GNU Affero GPL software license. You can <a
href="http://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet">download the
source code</a> and help us develop it.
You&rsquo;re welcome to use it in your own projects, although you must also
make available the source code to any such projects.
<a href="http://www.fiksgatami.no/">Fiksgatami</a> is an example of our code
being used in a Norwegian version of this site.
</dd>
<dt>I&rsquo;d prefer code in a different language?</dt>
<dd>
VisibleGovernment.ca wrote their own code for
<a href="http://www.fixmystreet.ca/">http://www.fixmystreet.ca/</a>, which is
written in GeoDjango and available under an MIT licence at <a
href="http://github.com/visiblegovernment/django-fixmystreet/tree/master">github</a>.
Or <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.org.nz/">FixMyStreet.org.nz</a> is written in
Drupal.
</p>
</dd>
        <dt>People build things, not organisations. Who <em>actually</em> built it?</dt>
        <dd>Matthew Somerville and Francis Irving wrote the site,
Chris Lightfoot wrote the tileserver and map cutter, Richard Pope created
our pins, Deborah Kerr keeps things up-to-date and does user support,
Ayesha Garrett designed our posters, and Tom Steinberg managed it all.
