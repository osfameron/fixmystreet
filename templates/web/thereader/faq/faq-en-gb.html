    <dl>
        <dt>What is the City of Readers Map App?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                We have devised this map so everyone in the city can take part in City of Readers.  
                We want you to share your:
                <ul>
                <li>book groups
                <li>favourite reading spots 
                <li>reading events
                <li>school / library / community centre activities and
                <li>literary facts about liverpool
                </ul>
                This is very easy to do - simply go to <a href="/">'tell us a story'</a> 
                and follow the simple steps.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Why not look up other events, activities and facts while you're
                here?  
                Simply go to <a href="/reports">'all stories'</a> and click on the map or use the
                drop down list.

        <dt>Who is this project run by?</dt>
        <dd> See the <a href="http://www.cityofreaders.org/">City of Readers</a>
        website for full details! </dd>

        <dt>What software is running this site?</dt>
        <dd>This map uses <a href="http://code.fixmystreet.com/">FixMyStreet</a> by mySociety.  
        FixMyStreet is a site to
        help people report, view, or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found
        to their local council by simply locating them on a map. It launched in
        early February 2007.
        <br />
        The City of Readers mapping project uses the core functionality, but with
        customised wordings, to talk about stories and events instead of potholes!
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After entering a postcode or location, you are presented
with a map of that area. You can view stories already reported in that area,
or tell ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>

        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes.
</dd>

        <dt> Where did you get the book icons on the map from? </dt>
        <dd> These are from the <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset:minecraft-icons"> Minecraft Icons</a> set by <a href="http://chrisl21.deviantart.com/">ChrisL21 on deviantart</a>
        (with minor tweaks to get them in different colours) used with permission as non-commercial usage.

    <dt>Can I use the City of Readers Map on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The website should work on your mobile phone or tablet, adapting to
    the size of your screen automatically.

    <h2>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>City of Readers is not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>
    <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
    <dd>Thanks for asking politely &ndash; we never quite understand why some of the rudest
    emails we receive are on this topic. The British national
    grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey (the British national
    mapping agency) around the time of the second world war, uses eastings and
    northings measured in metres and kilometres; the maps we use are from
    Ordnance Survey and so this is what we use to display distances.
    There you have it: not everything British is in miles!</dd>

    <h2><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who gets to see my email address?</dt>
        <dd>If you submit a problem, we pass on your details, and details
of the story, to the City of Readers team.
Only people we authorise to view the administration interface
will be able to see your email address and they will never use it for anything other than 
to help administer the map. Similarly with email addresses from updates. We will never give or sell your email address to anyone else, 
unless we are obliged to by law. Your name will not be published anywhere unless you let us.</dd>
        <dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address?</dt>
        <dd>Never. We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
story you&rsquo;ve reported.
We will only ever send you emails in relation to your story.</dd>

    <h2>Organisation Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who built the City of Readers Map?</dt>
        <dd>
        The map runs on the FixMyStreet software, and was built by the team at
        <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/faq#organisation">mySociety</a>.
        The City of Readers map project was built by Hakim Cassimally (of
        mySociety, but as a personal project), originally at an
        <a href="http://impact48.org/2013/12/19/a-readerly-impact48/">Impact48</a> hack-weekend.
